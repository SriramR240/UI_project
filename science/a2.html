                Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, so it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going into development
                and deployment.This article would feaature details some of the widely-used vaccines and their efficiency in fighting off the virus.
            </p>

            <h2>Pfizer-BioNTech</h2>
            <p>
                The ingredients Of this vaccine are mRNA, lipids ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate),2 [(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol), 
                potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and sucrose.<br><br>
                mRNA, delivered to your body's cells by lipid nanoparticles, instructs the cells to generate the spike protein found on the surface of the novel coronavirus that initiates infection.Instructing cells to generate the spike protein spurs an immune response, 
                including generation of antibodies specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.mRNA vaccines do not contain any virus particles, meaning that they don't contain weakened or dead parts of a virus or bacterium.
                The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires storage at about -70 degrees C, which requires specialized freezers.
            </p>
            <h2>Moderna</h2>
            <p>
                The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine contains the following ingredients: messenger ribonucleic acid(mRNA), lipids (SM-102, polyethylene glycol [PEG] 2000 dimyristoyl glycerol [DMG],
                cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC]), tromethamine,tromethamine hydrochloride, acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, and sucrose<br><br>
                The vaccine functions similar to the Pfizer vaccine as they are both mRNA type.The vaccine is stable at 2 to 4 degrees F for up to 30 days and can be stored for up to six months at -20 degrees C
            </p>

            <h2>Oxford-AstraZeneca</h2>
            <p>
                The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca. The vaccine works by delivering the genetic code of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the body’s cells, similarly to the BNT162b2 vaccine. 
                It involves injecting a part of the virus into the body.Once inside the body, the spike protein is produced, causing the immune system to recognise it and initiate an immune response.
                This means that if the body later encounters the spike protein of the coronavirus, the immune system will recognise it and destroy it before causing infection
            </p>

            <h2>Sputnik V</h2>
            <p>
                The COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac) is an adenoviral-based, two-part vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
                Produced in Russia, Sputnik V uses a weakened virus to deliver small parts of a pathogen and stimulate an immune response.
                Sputnik V is a two-component vaccine in which adenovirus serotypes 5 and 26 are used. A fragment of tissue-type plasminogen activator is not used, and the antigen insert is an unmodified full-length S-protein. 
                Sputnik V vaccine is produced with the HEK293 cell line
            </p>

            <h2>Bharat Biotech</h2>
            <p>
                The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) high containment facility.
                The vaccine is developed using Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell derived platform technology. Inactivated vaccines do not replicate and are therefore unlikely to revert and cause pathological effects.
                They contain dead virus, incapable of infecting people but still able to instruct the immune system to mount a defensive reaction against an infection.
                It does not require sub-zero storage, no reconstitution requirement, and ready to use liquid in multi-dose vials, stable at 2-8 degrees C
            </p>

            <h2>Novovax</h2>
            <p>
                NVX-CoV2373 is a subunit vaccine, which means that, unlike the other vaccines that work by tricking the body’s cells to manufacture the parts of the virus that then trigger the immune system, 
                it is made up with proteins from the virus already attached to a carrier and these trigger the immune system directly.These proteins have been developed using Novavax’s recombinant nanoparticle technology, and are encoded by the genetic sequence of the Covid-19 spike protein produced in insect cells. 
                The vaccine’s adjuvant then helps to enhance the immune response.
