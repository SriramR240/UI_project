                <h1>Crypto Currency BloodBath<br> Bitcoin plunges $30,000, market cap losses nearly $177 billion</h1><br>
                <p>The cryptocurrency market on Wednesday saw a big correction with prices of major currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB and others crashing as much as 30% within 24 hours. Cryptocurrency Bitcoin on May 19 declined almost 30 percent to $31,000, wiping out more than $500 billion in value from the coin’s peak market value. The other coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network Ether dropped about 15 percent to $2,875.36. This came in the backdrop of Chinese regulators Tuesday announcing a crackdown on cryptocurrencies.</p>

                <h2>What happened in Cryptocurrency Market?</h2>
                    <p>Prices of cryptocurrencies nosedived after China banned its financial and payment institutions from providing crypto services. According to crypto-trading platform Binance, as of 7pm IST Wednesday, Bitcoin — the most well-known cryptocurrency — was trading nearly 21% lower than its price 24 hours earlier at $34,693.1. Another popular cryptocurrency Ethereum was down 25% at $2,453.15 while Binance Coin or BNB was down almost 31% at $353.12.</p>
                <h2>What has China announced?</h2>
                     <p>China has barred financial institutions and payment companies from providing any services related to cryptocurrency transactions. This means that banks and online payments channels must not offer clients any service involving cryptocurrency, such as registration, trading, clearing and settlement. China had issued such a ban in 2017 as well, but compared with the previous ban, the new rules have expanded the scope of prohibited services, and surmise that “virtual currencies are not supported by any real value”.</p>
                <h2>Other Reasons behind CryptoCurrency Crash:</h2>
                    <ul id="reasons">
                        <li>The recent slide is a reversal from the dramatic rise that started in the second half of last year.</li>
                        <li>Part of the reason for bitcoin’s weakness seems to be at least a temporary reversal in broader acceptance for cryptocurrency, as well as regulatory concerns and weakness in more speculative areas of financial markets</li>
                        <li>Musk announced last week that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin as payment, citing environmental concerns.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>Institutional support retreats</h2>
                <p>Part of the reason for bitcoin’s weakness seems to be at least a temporary reversal in the theory of broader acceptance for cryptocurrency.
                Earlier this year, Musk announced he was buying more than $1 billion of it for his automaker’s balance sheet. Several payments firms announced they were upgrading their capabilities for more crypto actions, and major Wall Street banks began working on crypto trading teams for their clients. Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange company, went public through a direct listing in mid-April.</p>
                <figure align='center'>

                </figure>
                <p>However, Musk announced last week that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin as payment, citing environmental concerns. He did suggest on Wednesday that Tesla is not selling its existing bitcoin holding, using emojis on Twitter to say the company has “diamond hands.”

                And Coinbase, which surged above $400 shortly after its first trade on April 14, quickly gave up those gains and was down near $220 per share on Wednesday morning. Its direct listing date is also the day of bitcoin’s most-recent all-time high.</p>

                <p>Additionally, a new report from JPMorgan said that, based on futures contracts, institutional investors appeared to be moving away from bitcoin and back to gold. Bitcoin is often touted as a potential replacement for the traditional metal as a store of value.</p>
                <h2>A risk-off trade?</h2>
                <p>The weakness is not isolated in crypto, suggesting that the moves could be part of a larger rotation by investors away from more speculative trades.Tech and growth stocks, many of which outperformed the broader market dramatically during the coronavirus pandemic, have also struggled in recent weeks.</p>
                <p>The Ark Innovation ETF, a fund of high-growth stocks led by star fund manager Cathie Wood, is down more than 30% from its February highs. As of Wednesday morning, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has fallen 6.9% from its most recent closing high on April 26. The small cap Russell 2000 is down 5.6% over the same period.The declines have also coincided with the delayed deadline for tax payments, which could have caused selling pressure as investors looked for cash to pay off capital gains tax liabilities.</p>
                <h2>Regulatory concerns</h2>
                <p>Bitcoin and related assets have also come under increased scrutiny from regulators around the world as they have grown into a bigger part of the financial markets.</p>
                <blockquote><em>“We believe government crackdown on cryptocurrencies can trigger another ‘crypto winter’ and reduced trading activity. Harsher crackdown on crypto is possible in many developing countries which may view crypto as a threat to their fiat currencies and monetary system,”</em> -Bernstein’s Harshita Rawat said in a note Tuesday.</blockquote>
                <p>China, which is developing its own government-run cryptocurrency, reasserted its rules against other digital currencies on Tuesday, banning financial companies from providing services for crypto trading. In the U.S., newly appointed Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said earlier this month that he thought regulators should be <em>“technology neutral”</em> but more consumer protection is needed in crypto markets.</p>
                <figure align='center'>
                    <img src="images/dogecoin.png" alt="Dogecoin YTD Graph">
                </figure>
                <p>The rise of dogecoin, which was started purely as a joke before gaining wider popularity with the help of Musk, could also have hurt the overall credibility of the crypto market. Some of the moves in the smaller, less-developed coins suggest that the crypto bull market was tied to the rise of speculative day trading in stocks instead of the increased institutional interest.</p>
                <p>Other less serious cryptocurrencies have also seen increased interest in recent weeks. On Monday, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy announced that he purchased $40,000 of a cryptocurrency called safemoon, which he described as a <em>“s---coin”</em>.</p>

                <blockquote><em>“It’s early. If it is a Ponzi, get in on the ground floor,”</em>-Portnoy said in a video posted on Twitter</blockquote>

                <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                <p>A crackdown by one of the world’s biggest economy notwithstanding, those in the ecosystem have termed this decline as a short-term correction.</p> <blockquote><em>“A nearly 40% dip in the bitcoin price from its all-time high looks dramatic but is normal in many volatile markets, including crypto, especially after such a large rally. Such corrections are mainly due to short-term traders taking profits. Long-term value investors might call these lower prices a buying opportunity, as MicroStrategy just did,”</em> -Avinash Shekhar, Co-CEO of ZebPay, an India-based crypto exchange</blockquote>
