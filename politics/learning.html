The decline in recent weeks to a low of just over $44 for Brent crude, the international benchmark, has made Lee a short-term bull, Barron`s notes.

            The situation has taken a 180-degree turn from when she left for jail, after taking a vow, dramatically thumping Jayalalithaa's memorial three times.
            Chief Minister E Palaniswamy (EPS), who fell at her feet in gratitude after she handpicked him for the top post, has turned against her and has in fact shut the door on her.
            He also removed her as AIADMK general secretary. O Paneerselvam or OPS, the man who rebelled against Sasikala's leadership of the AIADMK, is now with EPS and a part of the AIADMK government as his deputy.
            Sasikala's nephew TTV Dhinakaran is also out of the AIADMK. He won the RK Nagar assembly constituency that fell vacant after Jayalalithaa's death and is now heading the AMMK, which managed close to 5 per cent votes in the previous election, but without the AIADMK's two-leaf symbol.
            It is, by itself, not a good option for Sasikala. In the end a good manipulator such as Sasikala is bound to trigger new problems within TN politics.

            Even after Rajinikanth met with district secretaries of his Rajini Makkal Mandram on Monday, not many were hopeful. When he sought more time, they thought their leader was setting them up for disappointment.
            But Rajinikanth has played the "will he, won't he" game too long. Some believe it may be too late in the day, given his age and health.Given the right circumstances, Rajinikanth's entry may shake up Tamil Nadu parties and alliances as they prepare for the Tamil Nadu polls due in five months.
