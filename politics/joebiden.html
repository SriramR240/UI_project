            Wednesday’s mass shooting in San Jose, California, is a grim reminder of the need for Congress to take action on America’s gun violence epidemic, President Joe Biden said in the hours after the ordeal.<br>
            “Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. We can, and we must, do more,” Biden said in a statement.<br>
             A lone gunman opened fire Wednesday morning at a rail yard serving Santa Clara County and killed eight people. The gunman, an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority, was among the dead, authorities said.
