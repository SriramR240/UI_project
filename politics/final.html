              Referring to the Twitter account of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany being shutdown for some time by the micro-blogging site, the president said that here's no freedom of press.

             Two years after siding with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic and economic offensive against Qatar, Trump welcomed here on Tuesday Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani to the White House as if nothing had ever happened.
              <Q>It`s a great honour to be with the amir of Qatar - a highly respected man, a real leader in a large part of the world and a very important part of the world. And we`ve known each other a long time. We`ve been friends for a long time,</Q> the President said as he sat alongside Al-Thani in the Oval Office, reported Efe news.

            Accelerating world oil demand and reduced supply from the <acronym title="Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries">OPEC</acronym> could push crude prices up to $60 a barrel before the end of the year,
             according to a report from Barron`s.The report cites research from Citigroup senior energy analyst Eric Lee, who previously called for a bear market in oil when the price was above $100. The decline in recent weeks to a low of just over $44 for Brent crude, the international benchmark, has made Lee a short-term bull, Barron`s notes.

            Talks of her forming a new party have been doing rounds for a while. Sharmila is likely to make a political entry into Telangana politics ahead of the 2023 state Assembly polls.<br>

             Deshmukh resigned on Monday from his post, hours after the Bombay High Court ordered a CBI probe into corruption charges leveled against him by formerMumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh.<br>
             Singh, in his plea filed on March 25, sought a CBI probe against Deshmukh who, he claimed, had asked police officers, including suspended cop Sachin Waze, to extort Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants.<br>

            The situation has taken a 180-degree turn from when she left for jail, after taking a vow, dramatically thumping Jayalalithaa's memorial three times.<br>
            Chief Minister E Palaniswamy (EPS), who fell at her feet in gratitude after she handpicked him for the top post, has turned against her and has in fact shut the door on her.<br>
            He also removed her as AIADMK general secretary. O Paneerselvam or OPS, the man who rebelled against Sasikala's leadership of the AIADMK, is now with EPS and a part of the AIADMK government as his deputy.<br>
            Sasikala's nephew TTV Dhinakaran is also out of the AIADMK. He won the RK Nagar assembly constituency that fell vacant after Jayalalithaa's death and is now heading the AMMK, which managed close to 5 per cent votes in the previous election, but without the AIADMK's two-leaf symbol.<br>
            It is, by itself, not a good option for Sasikala. In the end a good manipulator such as Sasikala is bound to trigger new problems within TN politics.

            Even after Rajinikanth met with district secretaries of his Rajini Makkal Mandram on Monday, not many were hopeful. When he sought more time, they thought their leader was setting them up for disappointment.<br>
            But Rajinikanth has played the "will he, won't he" game too long. Some believe it may be too late in the day, given his age and health.Given the right circumstances, Rajinikanth's entry may shake up Tamil Nadu parties and alliances as they prepare for the Tamil Nadu polls due in five months.<br>
            The veteran is seen to be close to the BJP's ideology. <Q><i>Rajinikanth's views are similar to the BJP's. We would appeal to him to support us,</i></Q> said BJP spokesperson Narayanan Thirupathi.

            BJP has become the talking point for all political parties either to criticise or appreciate, he said while responding to a query on the allegations levelled by DMK Chief M K Stalin that the saffron party was behind the recent protest meet organised by AIADMK.<br>
            Noting that a situation has arisen wherein the BJP has become the 'focal point' in the present politics of Tamil Nadu, he told reporters that the AIADMK was claiming that BJP was behind the DMK and the latter accused his party of operating the ruling AIADMK.
