            <p>
                On May 14th, The Chinese successfully landed its first rover on Mars, Zhurong, becoming the second only nation to do so. 
                It was all part of the Tianwan-1 mission (translates to ‘Heavenly Questions’) ,China’s first interplanetary endeavour which was launched on a Long March rocket in July 2020.
                The orbiter arrived at the red planet in February 2021 and had been circling in for around 3 months. 
                The mission lander with the rover attached to it was separated from the orbiter and begun to plunge towards the surface. 
                It managed to went through the ‘seven minutes of terror’ and made a soft landing on the Utopia Planitia region on the martian surface
                <br><br>
                The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has not yet officially confirmed the successful landing, but it has been announced on social media by the state-run China Global Television Network (CGTN) and by researchers at Macau University of Science and Technology in China
            </p>

            <h2>China Mars landing is historic</h2>
            <p>
                China’s Mars landing is historic by all accounts. So far only the United States has successfully managed to land its rovers on the planet and also deploy them for exploration. 
                The former Soviet Union did manage to land on Mars, but the mission only a partial success as they lost contact soon after landing. Technically, China is third to land on Mars if one counts the Russian landing, but given that it has deployed the rover, China is only the second country to do so.
            </p>

            <h2>Facts about the Zhurong</h2>
            <p>
                China's Mars rover, called Zhurong after an ancient fire god in Chinese mythology, will part ways with the lander by driving down a foldable ramp. Once it has deployed, the rover is expected to spend at least 90 Mars days (or about 93 Earth days) roving around on Mars to study the planet's composition and look for signs of water ice. 
                Utopia Planitia is believed to contain vast amounts of water ice beneath the surface.  
                The six-wheeled rover, which is about the size of NASA's twin Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity, carries six scientific instruments on board, including two panoramic cameras, a ground-penetrating radar and a magnetic field detector.
                It also has a laser that it can use to zap rocks and study their composition, as well as a meteorological instrument to study the climate and weather on Mars.

            <h2>Mission Objectives</h2>
            <p>This is China's first interplanetary mission, as well as its first independent probe to Mars. The primary goal is therefore to validate China's deep space communications and control technologies, as well as the Administration's ability to successfully orbit and land spacecraft.
             From a scientific point of view, the mission must meet five objectives:<br>
            
             <ul>
                
                <li>Study the geological structure of Mars and that structure's historical evolution. To do this, the probe will analyze topographical data from characteristic regions such as dry riverbeds, the reliefs of volcanoes, glaciers at the poles, areas affected by wind erosion, etc. The two cameras present on the orbiter are dedicated to this objective.</li>
                <li>Study the characteristics of both the surface and underground layers of Martian soil, as well as the distribution of water ice. This is the role of the radars present on the orbiter and the rover.</li>
                <li>Study the composition and type of rocks on the Martian surface, carbonate minerals present in ancient lakes, rivers, and other landscapes resulting from the past presence of water on the planet, and weathering mineral such as hematites, 
                    lamellar silicates, sulphate hydrates and perchlorate. The spectrometers on board the orbiter and the rover as well as the multispectral camera are dedicated to this objective.</li>
                <li>Study the ionosphere, the climate, the seasons, and more generally the atmosphere of Mars, both in its near-space environment and on its surface. This is the role of the two particle detectors present on the orbiter as well as of the rover's weather station.</li>
                <li>Study the internal structure of Mars, its magnetic field, the history of its geological evolution, the internal distribution of its mass, and its gravitational field. The magnetometers as well as the radars present on the orbiter and the rover are dedicated to this objective</li>

            <p>
                Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, so it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going into development
                and deployment.This article would feaature details some of the widely-used vaccines and their efficiency in fighting off the virus.
            </p>

            <h2>Pfizer-BioNTech</h2>
            <p>
                The ingredients Of this vaccine are mRNA, lipids ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate),2 [(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol), 
                potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and sucrose.<br><br>
                mRNA, delivered to your body's cells by lipid nanoparticles, instructs the cells to generate the spike protein found on the surface of the novel coronavirus that initiates infection.Instructing cells to generate the spike protein spurs an immune response, 
                including generation of antibodies specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.mRNA vaccines do not contain any virus particles, meaning that they don't contain weakened or dead parts of a virus or bacterium.
                The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires storage at about -70 degrees C, which requires specialized freezers.
            </p>
            <h2>Moderna</h2>
            <p>
                The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine contains the following ingredients: messenger ribonucleic acid(mRNA), lipids (SM-102, polyethylene glycol [PEG] 2000 dimyristoyl glycerol [DMG],
                cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC]), tromethamine,tromethamine hydrochloride, acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, and sucrose<br><br>
                The vaccine functions similar to the Pfizer vaccine as they are both mRNA type.The vaccine is stable at 2 to 4 degrees F for up to 30 days and can be stored for up to six months at -20 degrees C
            </p>

            <h2>Oxford-AstraZeneca</h2>
            <p>
                The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca. The vaccine works by delivering the genetic code of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the body’s cells, similarly to the BNT162b2 vaccine. 
                It involves injecting a part of the virus into the body.Once inside the body, the spike protein is produced, causing the immune system to recognise it and initiate an immune response.
                This means that if the body later encounters the spike protein of the coronavirus, the immune system will recognise it and destroy it before causing infection
            </p>

            <h2>Sputnik V</h2>
            <p>
                The COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac) is an adenoviral-based, two-part vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
                Produced in Russia, Sputnik V uses a weakened virus to deliver small parts of a pathogen and stimulate an immune response.
                Sputnik V is a two-component vaccine in which adenovirus serotypes 5 and 26 are used. A fragment of tissue-type plasminogen activator is not used, and the antigen insert is an unmodified full-length S-protein. 
                Sputnik V vaccine is produced with the HEK293 cell line
            </p>

            <h2>Bharat Biotech</h2>
            <p>
                The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) high containment facility.
                The vaccine is developed using Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell derived platform technology. Inactivated vaccines do not replicate and are therefore unlikely to revert and cause pathological effects.
                They contain dead virus, incapable of infecting people but still able to instruct the immune system to mount a defensive reaction against an infection.
                It does not require sub-zero storage, no reconstitution requirement, and ready to use liquid in multi-dose vials, stable at 2-8 degrees C
            </p>

            <h2>Novovax</h2>
            <p>
                NVX-CoV2373 is a subunit vaccine, which means that, unlike the other vaccines that work by tricking the body’s cells to manufacture the parts of the virus that then trigger the immune system, 
                it is made up with proteins from the virus already attached to a carrier and these trigger the immune system directly.These proteins have been developed using Novavax’s recombinant nanoparticle technology, and are encoded by the genetic sequence of the Covid-19 spike protein produced in insect cells. 
                The vaccine’s adjuvant then helps to enhance the immune response.
