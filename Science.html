            <p>
                On May 14th, The Chinese successfully landed its first rover on Mars, Zhurong, becoming the second only nation to do so. 
                It was all part of the Tianwan-1 mission (translates to ‘Heavenly Questions’) ,China’s first interplanetary endeavour which was launched on a Long March rocket in July 2020.
                The orbiter arrived at the red planet in February 2021 and had been circling in for around 3 months. 
                The mission lander with the rover attached to it was separated from the orbiter and begun to plunge towards the surface. 
                It managed to went through the ‘seven minutes of terror’ and made a soft landing on the Utopia Planitia region on the martian surface
                <br><br>
                The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has not yet officially confirmed the successful landing, but it has been announced on social media by the state-run China Global Television Network (CGTN) and by researchers at Macau University of Science and Technology in China

                Succesful landing of #Tianwen1, on #Mars! Landing point: 109.7 E, 25.1 N, less than 40 km from target location in Utopia Planitia.
                 More details expected later!

            <h2>China Mars landing is historic</h2>
            <p>
                China’s Mars landing is historic by all accounts. So far only the United States has successfully managed to land its rovers on the planet and also deploy them for exploration. 
                The former Soviet Union did manage to land on Mars, but the mission only a partial success as they lost contact soon after landing. Technically, China is third to land on Mars if one counts the Russian landing, but given that it has deployed the rover, China is only the second country to do so.
            </p>

            <h2>Facts about the Zhurong</h2>
            <p>
                China's Mars rover, called Zhurong after an ancient fire god in Chinese mythology, will part ways with the lander by driving down a foldable ramp. Once it has deployed, the rover is expected to spend at least 90 Mars days (or about 93 Earth days) roving around on Mars to study the planet's composition and look for signs of water ice. 
                Utopia Planitia is believed to contain vast amounts of water ice beneath the surface.  
                The six-wheeled rover, which is about the size of NASA's twin Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity, carries six scientific instruments on board, including two panoramic cameras, a ground-penetrating radar and a magnetic field detector.
                It also has a laser that it can use to zap rocks and study their composition, as well as a meteorological instrument to study the climate and weather on Mars.

            <h2>Mission Objectives</h2>
            <p>This is China's first interplanetary mission, as well as its first independent probe to Mars. The primary goal is therefore to validate China's deep space communications and control technologies, as well as the Administration's ability to successfully orbit and land spacecraft.
             From a scientific point of view, the mission must meet five objectives:<br>
            
             <ul>
                
                <li>Study the geological structure of Mars and that structure's historical evolution. To do this, the probe will analyze topographical data from characteristic regions such as dry riverbeds, the reliefs of volcanoes, glaciers at the poles, areas affected by wind erosion, etc. The two cameras present on the orbiter are dedicated to this objective.</li>
                <li>Study the characteristics of both the surface and underground layers of Martian soil, as well as the distribution of water ice. This is the role of the radars present on the orbiter and the rover.</li>
                <li>Study the composition and type of rocks on the Martian surface, carbonate minerals present in ancient lakes, rivers, and other landscapes resulting from the past presence of water on the planet, and weathering mineral such as hematites, 
                    lamellar silicates, sulphate hydrates and perchlorate. The spectrometers on board the orbiter and the rover as well as the multispectral camera are dedicated to this objective.</li>
                <li>Study the ionosphere, the climate, the seasons, and more generally the atmosphere of Mars, both in its near-space environment and on its surface. This is the role of the two particle detectors present on the orbiter as well as of the rover's weather station.</li>
                <li>Study the internal structure of Mars, its magnetic field, the history of its geological evolution, the internal distribution of its mass, and its gravitational field. The magnetometers as well as the radars present on the orbiter and the rover are dedicated to this objective</li>
